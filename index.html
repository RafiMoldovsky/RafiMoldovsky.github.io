											<h2>About me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! My name is Samson Rafi Moldovsky (although, I go by Rafi). 
											I am a recent Computer Science and Applied Mathematics graduate at UCLA who is looking for a full-time software position.
											I chose to double major because I love to combine mathematical concepts with computer projects and software fundamentals.
											I have over 3 years worth of experience working on computer science projects while learning several math topics.
											While my current endeavors are more focused on technology; I also have experience working in a legal office as an intern.
											So far, my favorite studies have been software engineering, operating system, algorithms, graph theory, and complex analysis.
											Moving forward, I plan to focus on my computer science interests and venture into the field of software engineering. 
											I hope to continue to gain experience in the software field and be part of the technological innovations of the future.
										</p>
										<br>
										<p>
											Outside of my studies I love to run and workout. At UCLA, I have been part of the Spikeball team. 
											We have practice 3 times a week and go to tournaments around the country to compete.
											Along with Spikeball, I love playing and watching soccer (West Ham is my team of choice).
											I also love spending time with my friends and family, and, while I go to school in Los Angeles, I am actually from Pennsylvania and love to visit back East.

											<h3><strong>Water Reservoir Data Display</strong></h3>
											<img src="images/Water Reservoir Image.png" width="300" height="300"/>
											<p>
												This water reservoir data display was my first project using Django. 
												I created this application using a Django backend, a React frontend, and a postgresSQL database.
												This application takes water reservoir data, and has 3 different search functions for looking at particular reservoirs in CA, NM, and AZ.
												For the selected database, water reservoir data is displayed using several graphs.
												I am personally proud of this project because I did it completely independently and learned a new software in a short time to great effect.

											<h3><strong>Biome</strong></h3>
											<img src="images/pic16.png" width="120" height="120"/>
											<p>
												Utilized a combination of Javascript, Node.js, React, and Python to design a housing website.
												Focused on backend implementation, specifically connecting the user database to the frontend, 
												allowing users to login and find past posts, to post housing offers, 
												and allowing users to make permanent comments on posts.

											<h3><strong>Animating Blocks Falling into Water</strong></h3>
											<img src="images/ComputerGraphics.png" width="220" height="220"/>
											<p>
												Used Javascript and Computer Graphics fundamentals to animate blocks falling into water. 
												These blocks have variable densities, which affect the splashing animation, and final destination of the block.
												Also implemented shadows within the tank, and a reflective surface using surface mapping. 
												The shadows correspond with a light on top of the tank which can be moved and has a variable intensity.

											<h3><strong>IOS Calendar and Todo List App</strong></h3>
											<img src="images/CalendarApp.png" width="220" height="480"/>
											<p>
												I recently started a personal project to develop an IOS app that would combine my needs for a calendar
												and todo list using Swift. The goal for this app is to be able to put all my assignments and due dates in one place
												on my iphone and have an autogenerated todolist from this calendar. I also plan on adding more features to both the list
												and the calendar as I continue to discover what maximizes my productivity.
